# Simple-Stick
A simple joystick emulator that turns your mouse into a joystick that doesn't return to the center when you stop moving it. It is difficult to find the zero point, so the middle mouse button has been assigned to automatically center it. This script is useful if you want to emulate a flight stick and don't want to spend money on unnecessary gadgets
